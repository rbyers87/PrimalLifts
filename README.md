clones wo-42 mostly working

shortened workout logger but still not able to update scores.  can't use "scores" to tell AI to update input numbers (reps, weight, time).  Scores is identified as totals on a different supabase table

scores can now be updated 5/2/25

disabled Eruda in index.html with //

site.webmanifest was moved to root to replace the manifest.json

for favicons the src has to be specific to the location of the images

5/5/2025 fixed workout on Sunday not showing in weekly checklist


working message board

last feature i'm working on but it seems computer is having a problem.  

"I want to use supabase storage for all photos, the photo selected for profile and photo selected for Welcome Page image."

Tokens: 208688 (prompt: 207809, completion: 879)
Okay, I will modify the components to use Supabase storage for profile and welcome page images. This involves updating the ProfileSettings.tsx and AdminSettings.tsx components to upload images to Supabase storage and store the URLs in the database.

**When updating the sql, please always make it where I can copy and paste directly in supabase sql editor without getting errors like "table already exists"


Project Setup with Supabase Storage
Click to open Workbench

Create src/components/settings/AdminSettings.tsx
Create src/components/settings/ProfileSettings.tsx
Create supabase/migrations/20250506000000_complete_project.sql
Run command
npm install && npm run dev
I've updated the ProfileSettings.tsx and AdminSettings.tsx components to use Supabase storage for profile and welcome page images. I've also added a storage policy for avatars.

I want to remove cloudinary and use supabase storage/buckets for everything. Created a bucket on supabase titled "primalphotos"

To get OneSignal notifications working in your PWA, follow these steps carefully. I‚Äôll explain the why for each step and show you exactly what to copy and paste.

‚úÖ 1. Add OneSignal Code to <head>
üìå Why:
This loads OneSignal‚Äôs SDK and initializes it with your app ID so users can subscribe to notifications.

üß© What to Add:
Place this inside the <head> of your HTML (e.g., index.html):

html
Copy
Edit
<!-- OneSignal Push Notification SDK -->
<script src="https://cdn.onesignal.com/sdks/web/v16/OneSignalSDK.page.js" defer></script>
<script>
  window.OneSignalDeferred = window.OneSignalDeferred || [];
  OneSignalDeferred.push(async function(OneSignal) {
    await OneSignal.init({
      appId: "50c1b3ba-6ce1-4ba9-b003-cb9e006c2be6",
    });
  });
</script>
‚úÖ 2. Ensure You Have These Files at Your Web Root
OneSignal requires these files in the root (/) of your website:

OneSignalSDKWorker.js

OneSignalSDKUpdaterWorker.js

üìå Why:
These workers handle background notifications.

üß© What to Do:
Copy these files from OneSignal's CDN into your project and serve them from the root:

public/OneSignalSDKWorker.js
js
Copy
Edit
importScripts('https://cdn.onesignal.com/sdks/web/v16/OneSignalSDKWorker.js');
public/OneSignalSDKUpdaterWorker.js
js
Copy
Edit
importScripts('https://cdn.onesignal.com/sdks/web/v16/OneSignalSDKUpdaterWorker.js');
If you're using something like Vite or React, put them in your public/ folder so they appear at the root when built.

‚úÖ 3. Remove Your Own push Code from service-worker.js
Since OneSignal uses its own service worker, you don't need to handle push and notificationclick manually in your service-worker.js.

You can keep the install and fetch handlers for caching. Here‚Äôs your cleaned-up file:

js
Copy
Edit
self.addEventListener('install', (event) => {
  event.waitUntil(
    caches.open('pwa-cache').then((cache) => {
      return cache.addAll([
        '/',
        '/index.html',
        '/manifest.json',
        '/src/index.css',
        '/icons/icon-192x192.png',
        '/icons/icon-512x512.png'
      ]);
    })
  );
});

self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
  event.respondWith(
    caches.match(event.request).then((response) => {
      return response || fetch(event.request);
    })
  );
});
üîç Final Checklist
‚úÖ <head> has OneSignal script and appId

‚úÖ You‚Äôre serving both OneSignalSDKWorker.js and OneSignalSDKUpdaterWorker.js from root

‚úÖ You don‚Äôt manually handle push events anymore

‚úÖ You‚Äôre using HTTPS
